# Code for TDD with Spring Boot

This folder contains a sample project with some fancy stuff
I've done with TDD.

## How to run

```bash
mvn package
java -jar target/fizz-buzz-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Some hipster things I've done here

* [VAVR](https://www.vavr.io/) for fancy FP in Java
* Bean Validation
* [Data driven tests with JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests)
* Own Argument Converter for String Arrays
